Were you ever crossing a large bridge and, while crossing, tried to freeze-frame yourself there and erase the whole bridge in your mind?
You're suspended in midair, and you're trying to imagine what would happen if the bridge wasn't there.

You'd fall, of course.

But you don't. The bridge is there, it was there yesterday, and it will almost 100% be there tomorrow, with cars, trucks and trains crossing it safely, even in the worst weather conditions. 
That's so **outrageously impressive** it should make you want to get out as soon as you cross the bridge, turn around and clap your palms off to the majesty that is that bridge's existence.

The bridge also really wants to fall down! It wants to fall down all by itself, and it **especially** wants to fall down when you use it, doubly so after the holiday season. 

Yet, there it stands, we just use it and move on like it's nothing, except we basically levitated across a river.

## A bridge too far gone

This is a stainless steel bolt.

It does a single thing and does it well: when you tighten it, it stays tight. It doesn't do anything else, it doesn't want to do anything else.
We use them to build bridges which cross vast distances, submarines which go into deep water, spaceships which go into space, and roller coasters which go into your stomach.
All those things are amazing, without the bolt being anything more than a bolt.

This is a stainless steel bolt which turns into a gummy bear at random.

It's kind of fun how it turns into a gummy bear, but you can't put your weight on it and know what will happen. It only sometimes works as a bolt.
Would you ride in a submarine using them? Would you cross a bridge made with them?

Why then use them in your software?

## Flexible vs malleable

It is a surprisingly common misconception, especially between junior developers, that the more complex and intricate the tools and languages we use, the more innovative and creative we get to be.

However, the opposite is true. The most effective production components are the mundane, predictable, and boring. The boring is what grants us the safe footing we need to reach for a software equivalent of blasting a person into outer space. The resulting solution gets to be exciting, the tools do not.

We want **flexible** tools, not **malleable** ones.

The main difference is flexible tools provide options, but we stay within the constraints:
- we add or remove bolts in a bridge
- we make a 6x6 LEGO plate from smaller plates

Malleable is when we can change the constraints themselves:
- change the properties of the bolts themselves to allow making the bridge a different shape
- melt down a 8x8 LEGO plate and make a 6x6 one

> The boring is (what) we need to reach for a software equivalent of blasting a person into outer space

Even if the final solution is not exciting, you still don't want the tools to be because [it gets old fast fixing tooling issues daily](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/comment-page-1/) on projects you don't even care about.

We want tools and languages that are boring and predictable. The stack we use must be well-understood, reliable, and consistent. The predictability of programming languages and frameworks allows developers to build complex and innovative solutions with confidence. Introducing unpredictability at the foundational level would lead to chaos, hindering the ability to create robust and dependable software.

## Conclusion

The boredom of production components is a crucial aspect of the creative and innovative process. Whether in the physical world or not, predictability is the key to unlocking the potential for groundbreaking solutions. Embracing the inherent predictability of production components enables us to build, create, and innovate with confidence, knowing that the foundations we lay are steadfast and dependable.
